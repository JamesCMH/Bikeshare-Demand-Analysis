# Washington D.C. Bike-Sharing Analysis and Predictor Model

## Project Overview

This project is an initiative undertaken for the administration of Washington D.C. to provide a comprehensive analysis and predictive model for the bike-sharing service in the city. Our objective is to assist the public transport department in better anticipating bike provisioning needs and optimizing the service for the residents and visitors of Washington D.C. The project leverages data from the years 2011 and 2012 to achieve its goals.

## Main Goals
1. **In-depth Analysis of the Bike-Sharing Service:** We aim to understand the usage patterns of the bike-sharing service to determine if any operational adjustments are necessary for cost optimization or service enhancement.

2. **Predictive Modeling for Bike Usage:** Development of a model to forecast the total number of bicycle users on an hourly basis, aiding in the efficient allocation of resources and cost optimization for the transportation services.

## Grading Criteria

### Data Analysis (3 points)
- **Data Quality Assurance:** Addressing data correctness, consistency, handling of missing values, and outlier detection.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Crafting clear and meaningful figures to reveal underlying patterns and insights.
- **Feature Engineering and Analysis:** Exploration of additional features like seasonality, holidays, daylight hours, etc., and their impact on bike-sharing usage.
- **Critical Analysis:** Discussions on the treatment of text and date features, handling of missing values and outliers, and the rationale behind decisions and findings.

### Machine Learning (3 points)
- **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate linear and non-linear models for the task.
- **Data Handling:** Proper splitting of data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Tuning:** Hyperparameter tuning and validation for optimal performance.
- **Accuracy and Insights:** Ensuring model accuracy and plotting predictions versus actual data for deeper insights.
- **In-depth Analysis:** Comprehensive examination of model results and feature influences.
- **Clear Documentation:** Detailed explanations of model choice, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics.

### Interactive Report with Streamlit (4 points)
- **Comprehensive Tool Development:** Utilizing Streamlit to integrate data analysis and predictive modeling insights.
- **Structured Presentation:** Effective use of headers, subheaders, and sections to present a cohesive narrative.
- **Interactivity and Visualization:** Incorporating Plotly for dynamic visualizations and interactive elements like text boxes, sliders, etc., in the Streamlit dashboard.
- **Data and Model Integration:** Efficient use of external files (CSV, JSON, etc.) for integrating data and model outputs into the dashboard.

## Additional Evaluation Criteria
- **Programming Style:** Clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- **Effective Library Use:** Appropriate and non-redundant use of libraries like pandas, sklearn, xgboost, etc.
- **Creativity and Originality:** Innovative approaches to solve the business problem and present the findings.
- **Comprehensiveness:** The tool should not only address the stated objectives but also provide additional insights and recommendations for the local government department.

## Conclusion

This project aims to blend data analysis, machine learning, and interactive reporting to provide actionable insights for the efficient management of the bike-sharing service in Washington D.C. It is a step towards smarter, data-driven decision-making in urban transportation management.

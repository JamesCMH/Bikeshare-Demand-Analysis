# Washington D.C. Bike-Sharing Analysis and Predictor Model

# Project Overview:
This project is an initiative undertaken for the administration of Washington D.C. to provide a comprehensive analysis and predictive model for the bike-sharing service in the city. Our objective is to assist the public transport department in better anticipating bike provisioning needs and optimizing the service for the residents and visitors of Washington D.C. The project leverages data from the years 2011 and 2012 to achieve its goals.

# Main Goals
In-depth Analysis of the Bike-Sharing Service: We aim to understand the usage patterns of the bike-sharing service to determine if any operational adjustments are necessary for cost optimization or service enhancement.
Predictive Modeling for Bike Usage: Development of a model to forecast the total number of bicycle users on an hourly basis, aiding in the efficient allocation of resources and cost optimization for the transportation services.
